## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js and npm (or bun)
*   Python 3.8+ and pip
*   Git

### Backend Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
    cd math-wiz-assistant
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the backend directory (if applicable, though `main.py` is at root):**
    *(Adjust if backend code is primarily in `backend/` and needs its own venv there)*
3.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate
    ```
4.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: Check the comments within `backend/requirements.txt` for any system-level dependencies that might need separate installation (e.g., Tesseract OCR, Poppler).*
5.  **Set up environment variables (Backend):**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the project root directory. This file is crucial for storing sensitive information like API keys.
    *   You **must** add your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (obtained from Google AI Studio/Cloud Console) to this file for all AI-powered features (math solving, CS content generation, learning aids, etc.) to work.
    Example `.env` file content:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE"
    # DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///./math_wiz_app.db" # This is usually handled by alembic.ini or backend config
    ```
6.  **Initialize and run database migrations:**
    ```bash
    alembic upgrade head
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the project root (if not already there):**
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/math-wiz-assistant
    ```
2.  **Install Node.js dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or if using bun:
    # bun install
    ```
3.  **Environment Variables (Frontend):**
    *   The frontend uses Vite and requires a `.env` file in the project root for variables like `VITE_API_URL` to connect to the backend.
    Example `.env` file in the project root (can be the same `.env` file used for backend): 
    ```
    VITE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
    ```

## Running the Application

### Backend

1.  **Ensure your virtual environment is activated.**
2.  **Start the FastAPI server from the project root (where `main.py` is):**
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
    ```
    The backend API will typically be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Frontend

1.  **Open a new terminal in the project root.**
2.  **Start the Vite development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or if using bun:
    # bun dev
    ```
    The frontend will typically be available at `http://localhost:8003` (as per `vite.config.ts`).
